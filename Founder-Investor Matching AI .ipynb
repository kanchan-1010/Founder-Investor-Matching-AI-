    "# Investor-Startup Matching Using Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project utilizes the **Google Gemini API** to analyze and determine the compatibility between startups and potential investors. It evaluates compatibility based on industry alignment, funding stage, and investment range, generating a **match score (1-100)** with an explanation of the reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Data Processing\n",
    "- Cleans and structures startup funding data from a CSV file.\n",
    "- Standardizes numerical values for accurate comparisons.\n",
    "- Handles missing data for improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ñ Gemini API Integration\n",
    "- Uses **Google Gemini** models to generate compatibility scores between investors and startups.\n",
    "- Provides a natural language explanation for each match.\n",
    "- Ensures API response handling and error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Investor Preferences Matching\n",
    "- Matches startups with investors based on:\n",
    "  - **Industry** (FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Investment Stage** (Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Investment Range** ($500K - $5M, etc.)\n",
    "- Computes a **compatibility score (1-100)** for ranking matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèÜ Ranked Results\n",
    "- Displays ranked matches with compatibility scores.\n",
    "- Provides insights into the alignment of startups with investor preferences.\n",
    "- Filters out mismatched investors to optimize the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "Install dependencies using:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install google-generativeai pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Up Gemini API\n",
    "To use the Gemini API, configure your API key:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import google.generativeai as genai\n",
    "\n",
    "genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY` with your actual Google Gemini API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "1. **Prepare the dataset**: Update the `file_path` variable in `investor_matching.py` with your dataset path.\n",
    "2. **Define investor preferences**: Customize investor criteria (e.g., preferred industry, funding range).\n",
    "3. **Run the script**: Execute the script to generate ranked investor-startup matches.\n",
    "4. **View results**: The output will display ranked matches with compatibility scores and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "Investor: Investor A\n",
    "Match Score: 90/100\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Strong industry match (FinTech)\n",
    "- Investment range aligns ($500K - $2M)\n",
    "- Series A funding preference matches startup stage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "üìÇ Investor-Startup-Matching\n",
    "‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ investor_matching.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook implementation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements üöÄ\n",
    "- **Enhance Investor Criteria**:\n",
    "  - Consider factors like investor location, past investments, and risk appetite.\n",
    "- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "  - Improve missing data handling with machine learning techniques.\n",
    "  - Standardize currency values for global investor-startup matching.\n",
    "- **Web UI Development**:\n",
    "  - Create an interactive web interface for user-friendly startup-investor matching.\n",
    "  - Allow users to input investor preferences dynamically.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Model for Match Prediction**:\n",
    "  - Train an ML model using historical startup-investor data for improved predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables üì¶\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook (`investor_matching.ipynb`)**: Contains code, explanations, and results.\n",
    "- **README File (`README.md`)**: Detailed project documentation.\n",
    "- **Dataset (`startups_data.csv`)**: Sample startup funding dataset for testing.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "- Industry: Excellent match. The investor explicitly prefers EdTech, and CollegeDekho operates within the E-learning space, which falls directly under the EdTech umbrella.\n",
      "- Investment Stage: Excellent match.  The startup is seeking Series B funding, which aligns perfectly with the investor's preferred investment stages of Series A and Series B.\n",
      "- Funding Amount: Good match.  The startup is requesting $35,000,000, which falls slightly outside the investor's preferred range of $1M-$5M. However, given the investor's focus on EdTech and the stage of the startup, this discrepancy might not be a deal-breaker, particularly if the investor is open to slightly larger investments for promising companies.  It could also indicate a potential for syndication with other investors.\n",
      "- Description/Potential: Strong potential. The description suggests a focus on student career goals, a large and growing market within education.  This focus, coupled with the success implied by reaching Series B, makes the startup an attractive candidate.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "- Industry: CollegeDekho operates in the E-learning sector, while Investor C prefers HealthTech. This is a significant mismatch and greatly reduces the likelihood of investment.\n",
      "- Investment Stage: CollegeDekho is seeking Series B funding, whereas Investor C prefers Seed or Series A rounds. This indicates a misalignment in the company's growth trajectory and the investor's typical investment strategy.\n",
      "- Investment Amount: CollegeDekho requires $35M, significantly exceeding Investor C's preferred range of $500K - $3M. This large discrepancy makes investment highly improbable.\n",

      "- Investment Amount: CollegeDekho requires $35,000,000, which far exceeds Investor A's preferred investment range of $500,000 - $2,000,000. This is a major incompatibility.\n",
