Investor-Startup Matching Using Gemini API
Overview
This project utilizes the Google Gemini API to analyze and determine the compatibility between startups and potential investors. It evaluates compatibility based on industry alignment, funding stage, and investment range, generating a match score (1-100) with an explanation of the reasoning.

Features
✅ Data Processing
Cleans and structures startup funding data from a CSV file.
Standardizes numerical values for accurate comparisons.
Handles missing data for improved accuracy.
🤖 Gemini API Integration
Uses Google Gemini models to generate compatibility scores between investors and startups.
Provides a natural language explanation for each match.
Ensures API response handling and error management.
📊 Investor Preferences Matching
Matches startups with investors based on:
Industry (FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, etc.)
Investment Stage (Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.)
Investment Range ( 500𝐾−
 5M, etc.)
Computes a compatibility score (1-100) for ranking matches.
🏆 Ranked Results
Displays ranked matches with compatibility scores.
Provides insights into the alignment of startups with investor preferences.
Filters out mismatched investors to optimize the matching process.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Required Libraries
Install dependencies using:

pip install google-generativeai pandas
Set Up Gemini API
To use the Gemini API, configure your API key:

import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY")
Replace YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY with your actual Google Gemini API key.

Usage
Prepare the dataset: Update the file_path variable in investor_matching.py with your dataset path.
Define investor preferences: Customize investor criteria (e.g., preferred industry, funding range).
Run the script: Execute the script to generate ranked investor-startup matches.
View results: The output will display ranked matches with compatibility scores and explanations.
Example Output
Investor: Investor A
Match Score: 90/100
Explanation:
- Strong industry match (FinTech)
- Investment range aligns ($500K - $2M)
- Series A funding preference matches startup stage
